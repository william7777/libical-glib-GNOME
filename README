Libical-glib is initiated from an GSoC idea in GNOME foundation, which is to introspect the libecal part in Evolution-Data-Server.
Since libical has been used by a lot of GNOME projects, we think it's better to target the whole libical project instead of only the EDS.
The whole project takes the API and types from libical and output the introspectable APIs and types in GNOME project.

The project will be continued and hosted on

1. Change all the shebang in tests to /usr/bin/env python3
2. Remove the -avoid-version from libical_glib_1_0_la_LDFLAGS in src/libical-glib/Makefile.am.
   Thanks to @Koop Mast: This causes libtool to not make the libical-glib-1.0.so.0 and libical-glib-1.0.so.0.0.0 symlinks. This will result in ld-elf.so not being able to find the libraries if I understand it correctly.
